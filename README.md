This repository contains my academic lab tasks, research work, and course completion certificates related to deep learning and neural networks. It includes multiple assignments where neural networks were implemented from scratch using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib to strengthen understanding of forward propagation, backward propagation, optimization techniques, parameter analysis, and model evaluation. The repository is organized into structured folders for lab exercises, research experiments, and certifications, reflecting both practical implementation and theoretical learning. It serves as a record of my academic progress and continuous skill development in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and lightweight neural network design.
